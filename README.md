# Deep Learning Projects

### Project 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition
1. Built a deep neural network on MNIST handwritten digit images to classify them.
2. Created a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model using tensorflow

### Project 2: Brain tumor detection
1. Performed transfer learning using VGG16 pretrained model to predict whether tumor is present or not by using MRI images.
2. Conducted fine tuning and calculated accuracy.

### Project 3: Face mask and social distancing detection.
1. Aimed to detect whether persons are maintaining social distancing and wearing face mask during covid-19 or not.
2. Used image dataset and pretrained model VGG19.

### Project 4: Image Sentiment Classifier
1. Built DL based model to classify happy and sad images.
2. Used CNN model.
   
### Project 5: Fake News Prediction Using Bidirectional LSTM
1. Built DL based model to predict whether the news is fake or not.
2. Performed text preprocessing and used word embedding technique to convert words into vector form.
3. Used bidirectional LSTM for model training.

### Project 6: Dog vs Cat Classification
1. Built CNN model to classify image of dogs and cats.
2. Performed data augmentation to avoid overfitting.

### Project 7 : Hate Speech Detection
1. Built an NLP-based Classification model to predict tweets as Hate Speech, Offensive Language, and Normal . 
2. Did text preprocessing, handled imbalanced dataset and performed Word2Vec conversion. 
3. Used bidirectional LSTM for model development and calculated loss and accuracy for model evaluation

### Project 8: Image Classification Using CIFAR10 dataset
1. Classified CIFAR10 dataset into 10 categories using CNN model.

### Project 9: Facial Emotion Recognition
1.  First trained on Facial Expression Recognition Dataset using CNN model and then it uses Opencv for getting access of webcamera and then prediction.
